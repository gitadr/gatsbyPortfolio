### I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.

I recently learned about Michelangelo’s belief that the figures he sculpted already existed within the stone. He simply set them free. He said he could see them in his mind’s eye, waiting to emerge.

It’s an empowering idea that a work wants to be created, and your role is to help it happen.
