### Just learn how to get stuff done

I saw this advice from President Obama recently and it resonated. Both in terms of what I appreciate in my team, and also what I should continue to strive to do in my career. Many things change over the years, but if your gravitate to the hard, important problems and attack them with a can do attitude, it goes a long way.

“The most important advice I give to young people is … just learn how to get stuff done,” Obama explained. “I’ve seen at every level people who are very good at describing problems, people who are very sophisticated in explaining why something went wrong or why something can’t get fixed, but what I’m always looking for is no matter how small the problem or how big it is, somebody who says, ‘Let me take care of that.’”

Projecting an attitude of “whatever it is that’s needed, I can handle it” at work, the former president added, will help you build a strong rapport with your co-workers and managers. “Whoever’s running that organization will notice, I promise,” he said.
