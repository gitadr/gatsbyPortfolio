As I approach my 5 year anniversary at Nearmap, i'm increasingly craving outside perspective on what gret design looks like in other orgs. I've recently found these three podcasts by Lenny Rachitsky to be super interesting.

I need to find time to turn these into articles...

- ['Brian Chesky’s new playbook'](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/brian-cheskys-new-playbook/)
- ['Building beautiful products with Stripe’s Head of Design | Katie Dill'](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/building-beautiful-products-with-stripes-head-of-design-katie-dill-stripe-airbnb-lyft/)
- ['Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus | Karri Saarinen'](htthttps://www.lennyspodcast.com/inside-linear-building-with-taste-craft-and-focus-karri-saarinen-co-founder-designer-ceo/)
