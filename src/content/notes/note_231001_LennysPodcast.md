As I approach my five-year anniversary at Nearmap, I'm increasingly feeling the need to gain outside perspectives. I believe it's important to challenge existing processes and incorporate new ways of working, and this becomes increasingly difficult without external influences or stimuli.

With that in mind, I've found three podcasts by Lenny Rachitsky to be incredibly useful in learning how other organizations approach design and product development:

- ['Brian Chesky’s new playbook'](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/brian-cheskys-new-playbook/)
- ['Building beautiful products with Stripe’s Head of Design | Katie Dill'](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/building-beautiful-products-with-stripes-head-of-design-katie-dill-stripe-airbnb-lyft/)
- ['Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus | Karri Saarinen'](htthttps://www.lennyspodcast.com/inside-linear-building-with-taste-craft-and-focus-karri-saarinen-co-founder-designer-ceo/)
