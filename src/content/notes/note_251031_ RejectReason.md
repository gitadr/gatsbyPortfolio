Love this. It's so easy to listen to the nay sayers. The doubters. This is another another reminder that to create something special, you need a certain amount of contrarian thinking. And the strength of character to stick at it long enough to know for sure it it can be. See also [Think Different.](https://www.aaronroot.net/note_190219_Marketing/)

### Jony Ive on rejecting reason to innovate.

“If it hasn’t been done and it’s of value, there’s really good reasons it’s not been done. And so when you’re confronted with those reasons, you’ve got two choices. You can say, ‘Oh, that’s a very good reason, I’m sorry for bothering you.’ Or you can say, ‘I don’t believe that. I’m going to find out more.’”

Jony Ive continues:

“George Bernard Shaw talked bout how you have to reject reason to innovate. You have to say, ‘We understand. This is all very reasonable. But I’m going to ignore you completely.’ And if you're a fairly sensitive person, ignoring very smart people is really difficult… But that decision to ignore expert option happens every single time we do something that’s new.”
