We've all been there - you start a new project with loads of motivation and excitement, but as time goes on, that motivation starts to fade. But why is that? What makes motivation so difficult to maintain?

In my experience, motivation can be broken down into three factors:

### Purpose

The is the reason why you're doing something. It's the driving force behind your actions and the foundation of motivation. When you have a clear sense of purpose, you know why you're doing something and what you're working towards. This gives you direction and a sense of meaning in your actions.

### Focus

This is the ability to concentrate your attention and energy on a specific task or goal. When you're focused, you're able to tune out distractions and stay on track. Without focus, it's easy to get sidetracked and make little progress.

### Urgency

The time pressure and importance you attach to a task or goal. When you feel a sense of urgency, you're more likely to take action and make progress. Urgency helps you overcome procrastination and stay motivated even when things get tough.

So, next time you're struggling to stay motivated, ask yourself:

- Do I have a clear sense of purpose? Why am I doing this?
- Am I able to focus on this task? What's distracting me?
- Do I have a sense of urgency? Have I set a deadline?

Answering these questions can help you figure out what's missing and act as a guide on how to improve it. Remember, motivation is a powerful force, but it's not magic.
