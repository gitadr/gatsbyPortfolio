There’s something quietly exciting about the idea of Jony Ive working with OpenAI. Not because of the scale of it, or the money involved—but because of the intent.

A team of designers and engineers, building a new kind of device. Not a screen, not a headset. Something that lives alongside us. A calmer kind of interface. The sort of thing you’d only attempt if you believed technology could be gentler, more human.

What stood out to me most wasn’t the product talk—it was Ive’s sense of responsibility. A belief that design, at its best, can move humanity forward. That how something works, and how it makes us feel, still matters. Maybe more than ever.

I don’t know what they’re making. But I hope it reimagines what it means to interact with AI in a deeply human way.
