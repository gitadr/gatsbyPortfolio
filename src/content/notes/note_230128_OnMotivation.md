We’ve all felt it. The spark of a new project—energy high, ideas flowing—only for that momentum to thin out over time. The question is why. What makes motivation so hard to sustain?

Don Weigel once shared a formula with me that I keep coming back to. He broke motivation into three simple factors: purpose, focus, and urgency.

### Purpose

The reason behind what you’re doing. It’s the foundation. When your purpose is clear, you know why you’re putting in the effort and what you’re working towards. Purpose gives meaning and direction.

### Focus

The ability to channel your attention and energy into the task at hand. Focus is what stops you drifting. Without it, progress slips away.

### Urgency

The time pressure and importance attached to the work. Urgency pushes you forward. It’s what cuts through procrastination and helps you keep going when things get hard.

So when motivation falters, I ask myself:

- Do I have a clear sense of purpose?
- Am I giving this my full focus?
- Have I created enough urgency to act?

More often than not, the answer lies in one of these three.
