Robbins is an Australian artist who harnesses the randomness of natural forces. He builds instruments that transcribe changes in wind or hydro movements into drawings. The idea of a perpetual creation caught my imaginations, this contraption could be left running day and night, indefinitely (or until the pen runs out).

I loved that it provided a physical representation of ephemeral events. Something that feels missing in a lot of the things I concentrate on now days. I think my brother would also really appreciate the mechanics of it all.
