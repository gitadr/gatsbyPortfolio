Ex nihilo is a Latin phrase meaning "out of nothing". I first saw the phrase used on Koen Bok's Twitter profile. I think it sums up a lot of feeling I have about starting a business. The ability to bring people together, solve problems, create value, where there was nothing before, is such an powerful idea.
