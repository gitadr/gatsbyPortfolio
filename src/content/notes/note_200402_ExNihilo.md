Ex nihilo is a Latin phrase meaning "out of nothing". I first saw the phrase used on Koen Bok's Twitter profile. I think it sums up a lot of feeling I have about starting a business. The ability to bring people together, solve problems, create value. Where there was nothing before. It's just such a powerful idea.
