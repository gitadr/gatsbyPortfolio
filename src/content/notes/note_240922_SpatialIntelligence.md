I enjoyed this a16z podcast on spatial intelligence. The intersection of wayfinding, human evolution, and spatial intelligence is super interesting. I think studying how models understand and navigate 3D space, as well as the similarities between reconstruction and generation, is fascinating. It will teach us more about how we understand and reconstruct (or generate?) the world around us.
