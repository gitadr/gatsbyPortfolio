I've been re-watching _The Bear_. I love the second series, especially episode 7, _Forks_. It's a homage to craft, a reminder of the importance of believing that what you do matters and making others believe that what they do matters. Itâ€™s about continuously raising the bar while pushing limits with purpose and awareness. Every second counts.
