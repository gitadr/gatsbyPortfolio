I've been re-watching _The Bear_. I love the second series, especially episode 7, _Forks_. It's a homage to craft, a reminder of the importance of believing that what you do matters and making others believe that what they do matters. All while raising the bar and pushing yourself in purposeful and mindful way. Every second counts.
