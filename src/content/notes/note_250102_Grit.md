What separates people who keep going from those who give up? And how do we create environments where resilience and success can thrive? Angela Duckworth, psychologist and author of Grit, has spent her career studying these questions. I recently listened to an episode of The Prof G Pod where she talked with Scott about what makes people gritty, how to foster spaces where people flourish, and how to raise kids who are resilient and capable. It was a super interesting conversation that got me thinking about how grit plays a role in both life and work.

Duckworth introduced an important equation to explain how effort works twice in the achievement process:

**Talent × Effort = Skill**  
**Skill × Effort = Achievement**

Talent—how quickly you improve—is significant, but **effort is the multiplier** that turns talent into skill and skill into meaningful achievements. It’s the **long-term consistency** of this effort that really counts.

She also breaks grit into its core components:

- **Passion**: A deep, enduring interest that gives direction to your life.
- **Perseverance**: The relentless drive to keep going, even when it’s hard.
- **Growth Mindset**: The belief that abilities can be developed through effort.
- **Deliberate Practice**: Focused, goal-driven practice aimed at improvement.

Duckworth backs up her ideas with compelling examples of high achievers, from Olympic athletes to leading entrepreneurs. She also weaves in the wisdom of others, like Nietzsche’s observation:

> _“Great things are accomplished by people whose thinking is active in one direction, who employ everything as material, and who never tire of combining the means at their disposal.”_

Ultimately, Grit isn’t about short bursts of effort—it’s about sticking with it, adapting when needed, and turning every obstacle into an opportunity. Success, Duckworth suggests, isn’t about momentary talent but the unwavering commitment to make your effort count.
