I've spent the last few weeks reflecting on how to define design. Is it a skill? A process? An outcome? The dictionary definition is:

### Design

/dɪˈzʌɪn/ | _verb_ | To plan and make something for a specific use or purpose.

### Solving problems

In short, I believe design is a process for solving problems. While this captures the essence, some would argue it undersells he more nuanced skills and activities involved. Still, it’s the simplest and most comprehensive definition I can think of.

Then I came across an interview with Airbnb's Brian Chesky from 2022, which takes the idea a step further. Chesky provides a thoughtful perspective on what design really means:

> “I think it starts by defining what design is. At the surface, design is how something looks—designers design how things look. But at a deeper level, design is about how something fundamentally works.
>
> Design is a way to assemble something to solve a problem. To think like a designer, the first thing you need is curiosity. You’re designing for people, so you have to understand and care about them. It’s also important to understand the industry, history, and why things are the way they are. This requires thinking in terms of first principles.
>
> Once you’re curious, the next step is to think holistically. Designers like to see the entire system. Part of being a designer is organizing many ideas, making trade-offs, and distilling everything down to its essence—what we often call simplicity.
>
> At the end of this process, you’ve been curious, discovered something new, considered all outcomes, and designed something that feels inevitable.
>
> Design isn’t limited to objects or clothing. You can design a company, how people connect, or entire communities. Almost anything can be designed. To solve society’s hardest challenges, we need more designers at the table. When there’s no good option, sometimes the best choice is a third option—something entirely new.
>
> That’s where creativity and imagination come in.”

This perspective underscores how design goes beyond problem solving—it’s a way of thinking and creating solutions that feel inevitable and impactful. It's also a call to apply design not just to products, but to the complex challenges facing our world today.
